# EANstarter
by Austin Liu

##What is EANstarter
This is my own personal starter project with AngularJS, Express, and Node already set up. It utilizes basic HTML (or EJS), instead of the default Jade. 

##Credits
Most of the code was generated with express-generator, and the rest was created by hand.
